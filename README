### NOTE: This project is no longer under active development and uses a deprecated version of the API. 

### Use guyzmo's fork at https://github.com/guyzmo/pyoctopart moving forward.

A simple Python client frontend to the Octopart public REST API.

For detailed API documentation, refer to the Octopart API documentation:
http://octopart.com/api/documentation

A note on API method/argument syntax:

There are a number of arguments in the Octopart API documentation which contain periods in their names.
When passing these arguments from Python, substitute an underscore for any periods.

Similarly, substitute underscores for backslashes in method names.

For example:
>>> o = Octopart()
>>> o.parts_get(1881614252472, optimize.hide_datasheets=True)
SyntaxError: keyword can't be an expression

Instead, pass the argument as:
>>> o.parts_get(1881614252472, optimize_hide_datasheets=True)

The library will perform the translation internally.
